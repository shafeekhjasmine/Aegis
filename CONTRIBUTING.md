# How to contribute

## Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](SECURITY.md).
- Check that the bug was not previously reported on Github issues (see above).
- If it's the case, please upvote the issue and provide any relevant additional information.

## Do you have a fix for an issue, bug or typo?

- Open a pull request with the patch and the team will review it.
- Make sure that you've run a PEP8 formatter and SAST.
- If dependencies are involved, make sure it's not breaking the app and do not have any known vulnerabilities.

## Do you have an idea or feature request?

- Use the discussion space above or reach out through email: contact[at]intuitem.com to see how we can help each other in an optimal way.

## Do you want to contribute to the code?

- Please check our Contributor Licence Agreement first. Our bot will ask you to sign it on first contribution.

## Do you want to create and share a library?

- Have a look to the tools directory and its readme. A python script will help you create your library very simply from an Excel file. To share it with the community, make a PR, or contact us if you are not familiar with Github.
